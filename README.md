This project presents an implementation of three distinct BERT models tailored for a multilabel classification task on a highly imbalanced dataset. To address the class imbalance, class weights have been incorporated to improve model performance across underrepresented labels. The evaluation includes a brief report comparing the three models' performance on the dataset.

However, due to the limited size and imbalances of the dataset, the results appear inadequate and may not fully reflect the potential of the models. This project serves as a representation of applying BERT models for multilabel classification in scenarios where dataset imbalance presents a challenge.
